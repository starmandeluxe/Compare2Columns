# Compare2Columns

Is a simple CSV parser that compares two columns of data and reports whether the second column has entries that are not found in the first column, as well as whether there is more than one match for a particular entry in the second column

For example, given the following .csv with these two columns of data

## How To Use

Step 1. Open it up
Step 2. Click the "Browse" button and choose a .csv file prepared with two columns of data (it will only read the first two columns)
Step 3. The analysis will start automatically and the results will show in the well area below
Step 4. That's all there is. You can click Browse again to choose a different .csv to restart the analysis.

## Future Enhancements
 - Nicer error messages on screen
 - Moar CSV functions (all-in-one tool!?)
